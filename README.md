# Cormorant_Counting
Project for the William and Mary Center for Geospatial Analysis

The code begins by dividing the inputted image into smaller 100 pixel by 100 pixel sub images. Then it increases the contrast, recolors the dark pixels (likely birds) black then red. The birds that are counted are recolored blue. The number of birds in each sub image are added to get the total number of birds in the original image. We will proceed to explain the code by defining each function and how it interacts with the other functions to count the number of birds in the image.
